        <h1>Discord Bot</h1>
            <p>
                I'm currently working on building a Discord Bot for Be4stBoard! 
                Once finished, it'll be possible to use the soundboard in Discord Voice Channels.

            <h1>Why?</h1>
            <p>
                Good question! 
                Honestly, I don't know. I wanted to make a Discord bot again, since I wanted to learn how to work with the new things. 
                (I didn't do anything on Discord bots since slash commands, buttons, etc.)

            It is not fully ready to be used. Yes, it is functional, but there still has a lot of work to do to make it easyily usable. 
            I won't garantee that it will ever be finished, but hey, the version currently up works!

        <h1>Never-Asked-Questions (NAQ)</h1>
        <h2>Where can I invite it?</h2>
        <p>
            You can't. This will be a self-hosted bot, since I don't intend to use it on a day-to-day basis. 
            Besides that, it is a really specific bot, so probably no server wants to use this exact version.
        </p>
        <h2>Can I use it anyway?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes you can! And it's also completely free! 
            <a href="https://github.com/twboom/Be4stBoardBot/wiki">Here</a> you can find information on how to use it!
