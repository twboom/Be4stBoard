# Be4stBoard
The original Be4stSie Soundboard!

## About
This is a small soundboard webapp with sounds from Be4stSie!

Please note: I'm not a developer, it is *not* my job. That's why my code can be very sloppy!

### Rewrite
Because I've learned so much since I last worked on this project I decided to rewrite it. You can follow the progress on the [Rewrite-branch][rewrite-branch] on the GitHub.

I'll be employing different techniques because, well, how Be4stBoard currently works is honestly stupid. On the rewrite I won't use frameworks, but Python will be used on server side to build the app on deploy. Still no fancy dynamic or database stuff...

## Features
Be4stBoard now only has one feature, the soundboard! However, you can find *all* the sources on the [sources] page!

Spoiler alert, new features are in the making!

## Be4stSie
