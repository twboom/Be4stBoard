# Be4stBoard
The original Be4stSie Soundboard!

## About
This is a small soundboard webapp with sounds from Be4stSie! It'll always be a hobby project, and I might abandon it for some time...

## Features
Be4stBoard now only has one feature, the soundboard! However, you can find *all* the sources on the [sources] page!

Spoiler alert, new features are in the making!

## Be4stSie
Be4stSie is a good friend of mine, he makes YouTube videos and streams on Twitch.
Here are his socials:
- [YouTube]
- [Twitch]
- [Twitter]

He also has a Discord server! Check it out [here][Discord]!

## Contributing
